<!-- This HTML page contains a <script> element that initializes a variable
     num to 30 and then uses a while loop to check if num is a multiple of 5 and, if so, displays it in the console.
      The loop continues until num reaches or exceeds 100. When you open this HTML page 
      in a web browser and open the browser's console (usually by pressing F12 or 
      right-clicking and selecting "Inspect"), you will see the multiples of 5
       displayed in the console window.-->
